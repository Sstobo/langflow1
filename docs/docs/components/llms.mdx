An LLM stands for Large Language Model. It is a core component of Langflow and provides a standard interface for interacting with different LLMs from various providers such as OpenAI, Cohere, and HuggingFace. LLMs are used widely throughout Langflow, including in chains and agents. They can be used to generate text based on a given prompt (or input).
