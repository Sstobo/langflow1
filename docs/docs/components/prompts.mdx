A prompt refers to the input given to a language model. It is constructed from multiple components and can be parametrized using prompt templates. A prompt template is a reproducible way to generate prompts and allow for easy customization through input variables.

### PromptTemplate

The `PromptTemplate` component allows users to create prompts and define variables that provide control over instructing the model. The template can take in a set of variables from the end user and generates the prompt once the conversation is initiated.

<Admonition type="info">
  Once a variable is defined in the prompt template, it becomes a component
  input of its own. Check out [Prompt
  Customization](../guidelines/prompt-customization.mdx) to learn more.

- **template:** Template used to format an individual request.
