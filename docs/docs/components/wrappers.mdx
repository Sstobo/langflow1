### TextRequestsWrapper

This component is designed to work with the Python Requests module, which is a popular tool for making web requests. Used to fetch data from a particular website.

**Params**

- **header:** specifies the headers to be included in the HTTP request. Defaults to `{'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>'}`.

    Headers are key-value pairs that provide additional information about the request or the client making the request. They can be used to send authentication credentials, specify the content type of the request, set cookies, and more. They allow the client and the server to communicate additional information beyond the basic request.
