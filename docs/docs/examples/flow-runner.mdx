# FlowRunner Component

The CustomComponent class allows us to create components that interact with Langflow itself. In this example, we will make a component that runs other flows available in "My Collection".

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: "img/flow_runner.png",
  }}
  style={{
    width: "30%",
    margin: "0 auto",
    display: "flex",
    justifyContent: "center",
  }}
/>

We will cover how to:

- List Collection flows using the _`list_flows`_ method.
- Load a flow using the _`load_flow`_ method.
- Configure a dropdown input field using the _`options`_ parameter.

<summary>Example Code</summary>

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document

class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        flows = self.list_flows()
        flow_names = [f.name for f in flows]
        return {"flow_name": {"options": flow_names,
                                "display_name": "Flow Name",
        },
               "document": {"display_name": "Document"}
        }


    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()
        # Get the flow that matches the selected name
        # You can also get the flow by id
        # using self.get_flow(flow_id=flow_id)
        tweaks = {}
        flow = self.get_flow(flow_name=flow_name, tweaks=tweaks)
        # Get the page_content from the document
        if document and isinstance(document, list):
            document = document[0]
        page_content = document.page_content
        # Use it in the flow
        result = flow(page_content)
        return Document(page_content=str(result))

```

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent


class MyComponent(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Custom Component"
    description = "This is a custom component"

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self):
        ...

```

The typical structure of a Custom Component is composed of _`display_name`_ and _`description`_ attributes, _`build`_ and _`build_config`_ methods.

---

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent


# focus
class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    # focus
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    # focus
    description = "Run other flows"

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self):
        ...

```

Let's start by defining our component's _`display_name`_ and _`description`_.

---

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent
# focus
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self):
        ...

```

Second, we will import _`Document`_ from the [_langchain.schema_](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/schema/) module. This will be the return type of the _`build`_ method.

---

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent
# focus
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    # focus
    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        ...

```

Now, let's add the [parameters](focus://11[20:55]) and the [return type](focus://11[60:69]) to the _`build`_ method. The parameters added are:

- _`flow_name`_ is the name of the flow we want to run.
- _`document`_ is the input document to be passed to that flow.
  - Since _`Document`_ is a Langchain type, it will add an input [handle](../guidelines/components) to the component ([see more](../components/custom)).

---

```python focus=13:14
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()

```

We can now start writing the _`build`_ method. Let's list available flows in "My Collection" using the _`list_flows`_ method.

---

```python focus=15:18
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()
        # Get the flow that matches the selected name
        # You can also get the flow by id
        # using self.get_flow(flow_id=flow_id)
        tweaks = {}
        flow = self.get_flow(flow_name=flow_name, tweaks=tweaks)

```

And retrieve a flow that matches the selected name (we'll make a dropdown input field for the user to choose among flow names).

<Admonition type="caution">
  From version 0.4.0, names are unique, which was not the case in previous
  versions. This might lead to unexpected results if using flows with the same
  name.
</Admonition>

---

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()
        # Get the flow that matches the selected name
        # You can also get the flow by id
        # using self.get_flow(flow_id=flow_id)
        tweaks = {}
        flow = self.get_flow(flow_name=flow_name, tweaks=tweaks)


```

You can load this flow using _`get_flow`_ and set a _`tweaks`_ dictionary to customize it. Find more about tweaks in our [features guidelines](../guidelines/features#code).

---

```python
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        ...

    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()
        # Get the flow that matches the selected name
        # You can also get the flow by id
        # using self.get_flow(flow_id=flow_id)
        tweaks = {}
        flow = self.get_flow(flow_name=flow_name, tweaks=tweaks)
        # Get the page_content from the document
        if document and isinstance(document, list):
            document = document[0]
        page_content = document.page_content
        # Use it in the flow
        result = flow(page_content)
        return Document(page_content=str(result))
```

We are using a _`Document`_ as input because it is a straightforward way to pass text data in Langflow (specifically because you can connect it to many [loaders](../components/loaders)).
Generally, a flow will take a string or a dictionary as input because that's what LangChain components expect.
In case you are passing a dictionary, you need to build it according to the needs of the flow you are using.

The content of a document can be extracted using the _`page_content`_ attribute, which is a string, and passed as an argument to the selected flow.

```python focus=9:16
from langflow import CustomComponent
from langchain.schema import Document


class FlowRunner(CustomComponent):
    display_name = "Flow Runner"
    description = "Run other flows using a document as input."

    def build_config(self):
        flows = self.list_flows()
        flow_names = [f.name for f in flows]
        return {"flow_name": {"options": flow_names,
                                "display_name": "Flow Name",
        },
               "document": {"display_name": "Document"}
        }

    def build(self, flow_name: str, document: Document) -> Document:
        # List the flows
        flows = self.list_flows()
        # Get the flow that matches the selected name
        # You can also get the flow by id
        # using self.get_flow(flow_id=flow_id)
        tweaks = {}
        flow = self.get_flow(flow_name=flow_name, tweaks=tweaks)
        # Get the page_content from the document
        if document and isinstance(document, list):
            document = document[0]
        page_content = document.page_content
        # Use it in the flow
        result = flow(page_content)
        return Document(page_content=str(result))
```

Finally, we can add field customizations through the _`build_config`_ method. Here we added the _`options`_ key to make the _`flow_name`_ field a dropdown menu. Check out the [custom component reference](../components/custom) for a list of available keys.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Make sure that the field type is _`str`_ and _`options`_ values are strings.
</Admonition>

Done! This is what our script and custom component looks like:
