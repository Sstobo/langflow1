To upload examples, please follow these steps:

1. **Create a Flow:** First, create a flow using Langflow. You can use any of the available templates or create a new flow from scratch.

2. **Export the Flow:** Once you have created a flow, export it as a JSON file. Make sure to give your file a descriptive name and include a brief description of what it does.

3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Finally, submit a pull request (PR) to the examples repo. Make sure to include your JSON file in the PR.

If your example uses any third-party libraries or packages, please include them in your PR and make sure that your example follows the [**‚õìÔ∏è Langflow Code Of Conduct**](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
