# MidJourney Prompt Chain

The `MidJourneyPromptChain` can be used to generate imaginative and detailed MidJourney prompts.

For example, type something like:

```bash
Dragon
```

And get a response such as:

```text
Imagine a mysterious forest, the trees are tall and ancient, their branches reaching up to the sky. Through the darkness, a dragon emerges from the shadows, its scales shimmering in the moonlight. Its wingspan is immense, and its eyes glow with a fierce intensity. It is a majestic and powerful creature, one that commands both respect and fear.
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  Notice that the `ConversationSummaryMemory` stores a summary of the
  conversation over time. Try using it to create better prompts as the
  conversation goes on.
