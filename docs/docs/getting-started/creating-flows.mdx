# ðŸŽ¨ Creating Flows

## Compose

Creating flows with Langflow is easy. Drag sidebar components onto the canvas and connect them together to create your pipeline. Langflow provides a range of [LangChain components](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/) to choose from, including LLMs, prompt serializers, agents, and chains.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/langflow_canvas.png",
  }}
/>

## Fork

The easiest way to start with Langflow is by forking a **community example**. Forking an example stores a copy in your project collection, allowing you to edit and save the modified version as a new flow.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_fork.mp4" />
</div>

## Build

Building a flow means validating if the components have prerequisites fulfilled and are properly instantiated. When a chat message is sent, the flow will run for the first time, executing the pipeline.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_build.mp4" />
</div>
