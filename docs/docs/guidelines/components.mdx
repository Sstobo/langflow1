# Component

Components are the building blocks of the flows. They are made of inputs, outputs, and parameters that define their functionality, providing a convenient and straightforward way to compose LLM-based applications. Learn more about components and how they work in the LangChain [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/components) section.

### Component's Features

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  During the flow creation process, you will notice handles (colored circles)
  attached to one or both sides of a component. These handles represent the
  availability to connect to other components, while their colors are type hints
  (hover over a handle to see connection details).
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  For example, if you select a <code>ConversationChain</code> component, you
  will see orange <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>o</span> and purple{" "}
  <span style={{ color: "purple" }}>o</span> input handles. They indicate that
  this component accepts an LLM and a Memory component as inputs. The red
  asterisk <span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span> means that at least one input
  of that type is required.
</div>

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/single-compenent.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  On the top right corner, you will find the component status icon ðŸ”´. Make the
  necessary connections, build the flow (âš¡ zap icon on the bottom right of the
  canvas) and once the validation is completed, the status of each validated
  component should light green ðŸŸ¢. Hover over the component status to reveal the
  outputs going through it in case of success, or the detected error in case of
  failure.
</div>

### Component's Parameters

Langflow components can be edited in the component settings button. Hide parameters to reduce complexity and keep the canvas clean and intuitive for experimentation.
