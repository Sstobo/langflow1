### Import and Export

Flows can be exported and imported as JSON files.

<Admonition type="caution">
Watch out for API keys being stored in local files.

### Code

The Code button shows snippets to use your flow as a Python object or an API.

**Python Code**

Through the Langflow package, you can load a flow from a JSON file and use it as a LangChain object.

```py
from langflow import load_flow_from_json

flow = load_flow_from_json("path/to/flow.json")
# Now you can use it like any chain
flow("Hey, have you heard of Langflow?")
```

**API**

Once you save a flow, the API endpoint is created with your latest changes. Click the "code" button to use that flow as an API. You can post-adjust component parameters using the global variable TWEAKS.

The example below shows a Python script making a POST request to a local API endpoint, which gets a prediction based on the message input.
