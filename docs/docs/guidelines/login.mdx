# Sign up and Sign in

## Introduction

The login functionality in Langflow serves to authenticate users and protect sensitive routes in the application. Starting from version 0.5, Langflow introduces an enhanced login mechanism that is governed by a few environment variables. This allows new secure features.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are crucial in configuring the login settings:

- _`LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN`_: Determines whether Langflow should automatically log users in. Default is `True`.
- _`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER`_: The username of the superuser.
- _`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`_: The password for the superuser.
- _`LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY`_: A key used for encrypting the superuser's password.
- _`LANGFLOW_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE`_: Determines whether new users are automatically activated. Default is `False`.

All of these variables can be passed to the CLI command _`langflow run`_ through the _`--env-file`_ option. For example:

```bash
langflow run --env-file .env
```

  It is critical not to expose these environment variables in your code
  repository. Always set them securely in your deployment environment, for
  example, using Docker secrets, Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets, or dedicated
  secure environment configuration systems like AWS Secrets Manager.

### _`LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN`_

By default, this variable is set to `True`. When enabled (`True`), Langflow operates as it did in versions prior to 0.5â€”automatic login without requiring explicit user authentication.

To disable automatic login and enforce user authentication:

```bash
export LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN=False
```

### _`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER`_ and _`LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`_

These environment variables are only relevant when `LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN` is set to `False`. They specify the username and password for the superuser, which is essential for administrative tasks.

To create a superuser manually:

```bash
export LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER=admin
export LANGFLOW_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD=securepassword
```

You can also use the CLI command `langflow superuser` to set up a superuser interactively.

### _`LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY`_

This environment variable holds a secret key used for encrypting the superuser's password. Make sure to set this to a secure, randomly generated string.

```bash
export LANGFLOW_SECRET_KEY=randomly_generated_secure_key
```

### _`LANGFLOW_NEW_USER_IS_ACTIVE`_

By default, this variable is set to `False`. When enabled (`True`), new users are automatically activated and can log in without requiring explicit activation by the superuser.

## Command-Line Interface

Langflow provides a command-line utility for managing superusers:

```bash
langflow superuser
```

This command prompts you to enter the username and password for the superuser, unless they are already set using environment variables.

## Sign-up

With _`LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN`_ set to _`False`_, Langflow requires users to sign up before they can log in. The sign-up page is the default landing page when a user visits Langflow for the first time.

## Profile settings

Users can change their profile settings by clicking on the profile icon in the top right corner of the application. This opens a dropdown menu with the following options:

- **Admin Page**: Opens the admin page, which is only accessible to the superuser.
- **Profile Settings**: Opens the profile settings page.
- **Sign Out**: Logs the user out.

/>

By clicking on **Profile Settings**, the user is taken to the profile settings page, where they can change their password and their profile picture.

By clicking on **Admin Page**, the superuser is taken to the admin page, where they can manage users and groups.
